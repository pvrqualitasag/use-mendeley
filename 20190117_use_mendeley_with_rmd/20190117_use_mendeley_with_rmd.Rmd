## Disclaimer
This notebook shows a few experiments how to use Mendeley reference manager with Rmarkdown documents.


## Background
Mendeley can export its literature data into `bib`-files. The user can choose between the two options of 

1. storing all reference in one `bib`-file or
2. creating a separate `bib`-file for each literature item.

In both cases, the generated `bib`-files are stored in a given directory. This directory must be known in order to find the `bib`-files that we are going to use to generate the references in our Rmarkdown document.


## Pre-requisites
For the sake of this demo, we are just fixing the directory where all the `bib`-files are stored in a simple variable called `s_bib_dir`.

```{r}
s_bib_dir
```


## Functionality
