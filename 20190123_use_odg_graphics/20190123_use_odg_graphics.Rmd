```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
knitr::knit_hooks$set(hook_convert_odg = rmddochelper::hook_convert_odg)
```

## Disclaimer
This document is used to debug and verify certain unexpected behaviors of `rmddochelper::use_odg_graphics()`.


## An Example
When writing a Rmarkdown document and we want to include a diagram or a figure, we can use the function `rmddochelper::use_odg_graphics()` as follows.


```{r firstodgfigure, echo=FALSE, hook_convert_odg=TRUE, fig_path="odg"}
#rmddochelper::use_odg_graphic(ps_path = "odg/firstodgfigure.odg")
knitr::include_graphics(path = "odg/firstodgfigure.png")
```

Executing the above command inside of the RStudio document, should bring up a window of `LibreOffice Draw` which can be used to construct the figure.

The problem could be fixed while updating `rmddochelper:::odg_draft()`.
